The code provides a simple command-line interface for managing an address book. Users can add contacts, view all contacts, or exit the program. The try-catch block helps handle potential errors during user input.
And here is the breakdown of everything that is happening in the code:

1. **Contact Class:**
   - The `Contact` class is defined to represent individual contacts in the address book.
   - It has a constructor that takes `name`, `address`, and `contact` as parameters and initializes the corresponding properties.

2. **AddressBook Class:**
   - The `AddressBook` class is defined to manage the overall address book.
   - It has a constructor that initializes an empty array to store contacts (`this.contacts`).
   - It has methods:
     - `addContact(name, address, contact)`: Creates a new `Contact` object and adds it to the `contacts` array.
     - `displayContacts()`: Displays all contacts in the address book.

3. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**
   - The entire script is enclosed in an IIFE, which helps to create a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope.

4. **Readline Interface:**
   - The `readline` module is used to create an interface for reading input from the command line.

5. **Try-Catch Block:**
   - A try-catch block is used in the `addContact` function to handle potential errors, such as if the user inputs are not provided.

6. **Command Line Interface:**
   - The `showOptions` function displays a menu with options for the user: adding a new contact, displaying all contacts, or exiting.
   - Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding functions (`addContact`, `displayContacts`, or exits the program).

7. **Execution:**
   - The program starts by displaying a welcome message and calling `showOptions`.
   - Users can interact with the command line interface to add contacts, display contacts, or exit the program.

8. **Classes and Objects:**
   - The code makes use of classes (`Contact` and `AddressBook`) to organize and structure the data and behavior related to contacts and the address book.

9. **Spread/Rest Operators:**
   - The code does not explicitly use spread or rest operators, as their use cases are not prevalent in this specific example. They are powerful tools for working with arrays and function arguments, respectively.
